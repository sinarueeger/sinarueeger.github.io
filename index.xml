      <description>To set up this website I have used some excellent material around blogdown, github and hugo.
Motivation Before going into the technical details, let me say something about motivation and inspiration. For me, it definitely helped to read the blogpost by David Robinson, being encouraged by Ma&amp;euml;lle Salmon and seeing many others leading by example (among many: Marie Christine Dussault or Kasia Kulma).
I might get into a more personal motivation in a future blogpost.</description>

      <description>I work (broadly speaking) in epidemiology. Within collaborations we often have to share sensitive data across institutions and are therefore likely to not share IT facilities. But the most often used options - bare e-mail or file hosting - are not secure, as they both work via a server that could potentially be exposed.
There are a handful of secure options around (ProtonMail or keybase.io, both working via encryption), but for those that trust open source projects the most and are familiar with a terminal I have written some basic instructions for asymmetric GPG encryption.</description>

      <description>My journey I studied Data Analysis &amp; Process Design at the School of Engineering in Winterthur, where I fell in love with applied statistics. I deepened my knowledge in statistical modelling with a Master&#39;s degree and by working as a research assistant. During my time as a biostatistician I enjoyed the interdisciplinary aspect and grew an interest in analysing genetic data - which ultimately lead me to my current position to Lausanne.</description>
