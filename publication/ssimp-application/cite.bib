    abstract = {Author summary Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) quantify the effect of genetic variants and traits, such as height. Such estimates are called association summary statistics and are typically publicly shared through publication. Typically, GWASs are carried out by genotyping âŒ 500â²000 SNVs for each individual which are then combined with sequenced reference panels to infer untyped SNVs in eachâ individuals genome. This process of genotype imputation is resource intensive and can therefore be a limitation when combining many GWASs. An alternative approach is to bypass the use of individual data and directly impute summary statistics. In our work we compare the performance of summary statistics imputation to genotype imputation. We observe that genotype imputation shows a 3- to 5-fold lower RMSE compared to summary statistics imputation, as well as a better capability to distinguish true associations from null results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of summary statistics imputation by presenting 34 novel height-associated loci, 19 of which were confirmed in UK Biobank. Our study demonstrates that given current reference panels, summary statistics imputation is a very efficient and cost-effective way to identify common or low-frequency trait-associated loci.},
