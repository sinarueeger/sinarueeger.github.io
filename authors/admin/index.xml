      <description>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Fellay Lab at EPFL, where I analyse human genomic data in the context of infectious diseases.
My interests include statistical modelling, statistical genetics, programming with R, reproducible analysis workflows, and topics intersecting health, medicine and technology.
I received my PhD in Life Sciences in 2018 from the University of Lausanne, where I worked on the imputation of GWAS summary statistics supervised by Zoltán Kutalik.</description>
