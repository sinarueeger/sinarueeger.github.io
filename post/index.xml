      <description>This is a brief write-up of my satRdays Cardiff experience.
First - what is a satRday?
It is an awesome concept: attending an R conference organised by a local RUG on a Saturday.
The programme in Cardiff had parallel sessions - tough decision-making to pick between promising talks!
dplyr workshop Kathrine Tansey kept us busy with a workshop on dplyr in the morning.
💻 rstudio-cloud project
Packaging workshop Heather Turner upgraded us on packaging.</description>

      <description>To set up this website I have used some excellent material around blogdown, github and hugo.
Motivation Before going into the technical details, let me say something about motivation and inspiration. For me, it definitely helped to read the blogpost by David Robinson, being encouraged by Ma&amp;euml;lle Salmon and seeing many others leading by example (among many: Marie Christine Dussault or Kasia Kulma).
I might get into a more personal motivation in a future blogpost.</description>

      <title>Getting started with encryption of documents</title>

      <description>I work (broadly speaking) in epidemiology. Within collaborations we often have to share sensitive data across institutions and are therefore likely to not share IT facilities. But the most often used options - bare e-mail or file hosting - are not secure, as they both work via a server that could potentially be exposed.
There are a handful of secure options around (ProtonMail or keybase.io, both working via encryption), but for those that trust open source projects the most and are familiar with a terminal I have written some basic instructions for asymmetric GPG encryption.</description>

      <description>+++ title = “Plotting Local Genomic Association Results in R” description = “” author = “” date = 2018-07-04T10:43:44+02:00 tags = [“statgen”, “R”, “data visualisation”, “R”, “ggplot2”] category = [“statgen”, “R”, “data visualisation”] draft = true +++
In this blogpost, I will show how to zoom into GWAS results and annotate the plot based on the information about that genomic region — with R and another specialised software.
Get summary statistics For this we need first some summary association statistics.</description>
