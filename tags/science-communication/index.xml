      <description>How to make a good poster Recipe Content Design  This is a tutorial on how to make a scientific poster from scratch.
It aims for first-time poster makers, but also for people like me that quickly lose themselves in choosing the right font for hours.
It includes a few self-declared best practices that helped me in the past. Those are at best ideas, and barely opinions. It is by no means a collection of strict rules and feedback is welcome!</description>
