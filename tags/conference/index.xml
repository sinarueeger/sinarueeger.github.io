      <description>How to make a good poster Recipe Content Design  This is a tutorial on how to make a scientific poster from scratch.
It aims for first-time poster makers, but also for people like me that quickly lose themselves in choosing the right font for hours.
It includes a few self-declared best practices that helped me in the past. Those are at best ideas, and barely opinions. It is by no means a collection of strict rules and feedback is welcome!</description>

      <description>This is a brief write-up of my satRdays Cardiff experience.
First - what is a satRday?
It is an awesome concept: attending an R conference organised by a local RUG on a Saturday.
The programme in Cardiff had parallel sessions - tough decision-making to pick between promising talks!
dplyr workshop Kathrine Tansey kept us busy with a workshop on dplyr in the morning.

Packaging workshop Heather Turner upgraded us on packaging.</description>
