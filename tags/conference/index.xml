      <description>The 3+ days at useR!2019 in Toulouse were packed with great talks1 and good food - hence the amuse-bouches word play.
Here are some R code bits from the conference. Hopefully convincing enough to start using a new package or change a workflow. Not everything was brand-new, but it was helpful to have someone talking through their inspiration and examples.
Check out the speakersâ€™ materials - soon there will be recordings too.</description>

      <title>A guide to poster making for scientific conferences</title>

      <description>How to make a good poster Recipe Content Design  This is a tutorial on how to make a scientific poster from scratch.
It aims for first-time poster makers, but also for people like me that quickly lose themselves in choosing the right font for hours.
It includes a few self-declared best practices that helped me in the past. Those are at best ideas, and barely opinions. It is by no means a collection of strict rules and feedback is welcome!</description>

      <description>This is a brief write-up of my satRdays Cardiff experience.
First - what is a satRday?
It is an awesome concept: attending an R conference organised by a local RUG on a Saturday.
The programme in Cardiff had parallel sessions - tough decision-making to pick between promising talks!
dplyr workshop Kathrine Tansey kept us busy with a workshop on dplyr in the morning.

Packaging workshop Heather Turner upgraded us on packaging.</description>
