      <description>The squared correlation is one way to estimate linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers. The problem is - correlations have to be computed ALL THE TIME for many statistical methods in genetics or to summarise results, but to get LD estimations quickly, for a specific population and in an automated way (e.g.Â with R) is actually suprisingly difficult.
In this blogpost I am exploring how to do this efficiently.
Goal At the end of this blogpost, we want to know the genetic correlation between two or more markers in a specific human population, so we can populate the locuszoom plot from the previous blogpost with colored dots.</description>

      <description>In the world of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) we often get a list of genetic markers (SNPs) that seem for some reason relevant for a particular outcome. At the same time, we have little knowledge about these genetic variants that come in cryptic combinations of characters and numbers.
For example:
 We might get asked how frequent the SNP rs1421085 is in a range of populations.  We need to extract all known SNPs that are within 1 Mb of rs1421085.</description>
